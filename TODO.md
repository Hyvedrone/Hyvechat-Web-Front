# Account Creation
Anons have the option to Sign-in with their Google account via one-tap sign-up ( https://developers.google.com/identity/one-tap/web/ ) if they want their session saved across platforms.
The anon/bee will need to additionally grant permission to read contacts via the "Google People API" ( https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts.readonly )
For the time being Google will be the only option to signup but alternate methods may become avaiable in the future.

## Verified Users (aka. Bees)
Can initiate a conversations.

## Anonymous Users (aka. Anons)
Annomous users will not be able to initiate conversations.
Anons can only join a conversation via a link.

# Conversations

# Basics
Conversations can have as many bees as they would like.
Anons will be limited to 5 per conversation (this may change in the future).
When a bee initilizes a conversation they have the option to add other bees via their email address, or name in their Google Contacts. 
When bees initilize a conversation that has an anon they will assign that anon a alias.
